# Program

## Fall 2018

- 26\. Jan:		__Erica Carlson__,	Purdue University 
-- Erica and her group work on the theory of strongly correlated electron matter. She works on stripes, noise, and fractal phase separation., _Host: Milan Allan_

- 16\. Feb:	__Roel Dulles__,	University of Oxford
  How do macroscopic properties depend on the microscopic structure and dynamics? Roel and his group use colloidal systems as a playground to address this question. _Host: Daniela Kraft_

- 23\. Feb:		__Vidya Madvahan__,	UIUC	
-- Vidya’s group performed many of the ground-breaking scanning probe experiments on topological insulators; her group investigates all kind of quantum matter. _Host: Milan Allan_

- 23\. March:  __Mete Atature__,		University of Cambridge		
-- Mete studies light-matter interaction. He works on plasmonics, chirality, optical forces, and strong coupling. _Host: Wolfgang Löffler_

- 04\. April	__Thomas Prisner__,		Universität Frankfurt
-- Thomas and his group develop new EPR instrumentation to study biological systems and nano materials. _Host: Martina Huber_
